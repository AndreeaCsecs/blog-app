Below is an updated README.md that incorporates installation/setup instructions, an overview of the approach, and details on the advanced features implemented (like hashtag filtering). You can replace your existing README.md content with this:

# Blog App

A responsive blog application built with Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and TypeScript. This project demonstrates static generation, dynamic routing, and client-side interactivity with advanced features like hashtag filtering.

## Features

- **Next.js App Router:** Utilizes Next.js’ new App Router for file‑based routing.
- **Tailwind CSS:** Provides a responsive and modern UI.
- **Dynamic Routing & Static Generation:** Fetches blog posts from the JSONPlaceholder API, pre-renders dynamic post detail pages using `generateStaticParams`.
- **Hashtag Filtering:** Implements client-side interactivity allowing users to filter blog posts by dummy hashtags.
- **Navigation Bar:** A reusable navigation component with active route highlighting.
- **TypeScript & ESLint:** Ensures type safety and code quality.

Approach
	•	Server Components:
The homepage (src/app/page.tsx) and post details page (src/app/post/[id]/page.tsx) are server components that fetch data from the JSONPlaceholder API. They leverage static generation (using caching) for performance and SEO benefits.
	•	Client Components:
The PostsGrid component (src/components/PostsGrid.tsx) is a client component that introduces interactive filtering via dummy hashtags. It maintains its own state to update the displayed posts based on the selected hashtag.
	•	Navigation:
The NavBar component (src/components/NavBar.tsx) provides navigation between the Home and About pages, using Next.js’ usePathname for active route styling.
	•	Styling:
Tailwind CSS is used throughout to ensure a responsive design that adapts to desktop, tablet, and mobile screens.
